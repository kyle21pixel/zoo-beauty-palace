# Zoo Beauty Palace

Zoo Beauty Palace is a full-stack beauty service platform inspired by ride-hailing systems like Uber/Bolt. It connects clients with beauty providers (salons) and freelance beauticians for both **on-route** and **on-site** beauty services via web and mobile applications.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The platform allows clients to request beauty services in two ways:

- **On-Route Services**  
  Clients visit registered beauty providers (salons). Requests are routed to provider dashboards.

- **On-Site Services**  
  Freelance beauticians travel to the client’s location. Clients can browse, compare, and select their preferred beautician.

The system supports real-time bookings, location tracking, payments, and role-based dashboards.
